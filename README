-----------------------------------------------

1. Compiling and installing:

First, make sure that you have a Linux(tm) system (a *BSD system should do it too)
* the KDE4 development packages must be installed (KDE4 >= beta4)
* the Qt development packages must be installed (Qt >= 4.3)

To compile, run:
./waf configure build

A few systems may require different options such as:
PYTHON=python2 PYTHON_VERSION=2.7 waf configure build

Then run the following installation command as root (important - Semantik will only work if installed):
./waf install

The generic command for creating a package is the following (packagers):
./waf configure clean build --prefix=/usr && DESTDIR=$fakeroot ./waf install

-----------------------------------------------

2. Getting started:

* double-click to add an item
* when a leaf is selected, type 'enter' to start in-place editing, type 'enter' again to save
* left,right,up,down keys to navigate in the tree
* alt+left,right,up,down keys to move the selection around
* double-click on a leaf to add a ramification
* double-click on a link to disconnect

Getting started with document generators:
* look at the scripts in src/templates/
* the naming is used for finding the files

Getting started with the diagrams:
* right-click to select a component to add
* press enter to edit the properties
* use the + to start dragging a connection
* select a connection and move the points to change its dimensions

More information can be found in about->help

-----------------------------------------------

3. Document generators:

* Be careful with documents that you have not created yourself, there are no security restrictions at the moment
* The document generation is performed in two steps: variable substitution and preprocessing
* Variables in the form @var_name@ are replaced by the corresponding document variables
* The core of the document is a variable itself
* A c-like preprocessor is then run on the resulting document, using (nested) conditionals such as:
  #if 0, #if !0, #ifdef var, #endif (the #elif construct is not supported yet)
* External viewers can be used, from the 'variables' panel, add code in the form
  'command_'+template_name=command_line, for example:

  command_html=kfmclient newTab %s
  command_odt=oowriter %s
  command_s5=firefox %s

  this is only necessary for documents that do not have a KDE mapping for opening them
* LaTeX commands can be inserted by using all_latex=1

It is also possible to export maps from the command-line (png or pdf):
semantik foo.sem -o foo.pdf

Diagrams can be exported in a similar fashion:
semantik-d diag.semd -o foo.pdf

-----------------------------------------------

4. Licensing:

Enjoy Semantik
